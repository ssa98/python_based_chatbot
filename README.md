## System Design and Architecture: Agentic Python-based AI Chatbot for PDF Understanding

### 1. Overview
This project aims to build an agentic AI chatbot in Python that can:
- Accept a PDF document as input.
- Read and extract content from the PDF.
- Understand and semantically process the content.
- Answer user queries logically, based on the PDF's content.

### 3. Component Breakdown

#### a. User Interface
- Web or CLI interface for uploading PDFs and chatting.
- Handles user queries and displays responses.

#### b. PDF Processor
- Extracts text and structure from PDF files (using libraries like PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or similar).
- Handles OCR for scanned documents (optional, using pytesseract).
- Preprocesses and cleans extracted text.

#### c. AI Reasoning Engine
- Embeds PDF content using NLP models (e.g., Sentence Transformers, OpenAI embeddings).
- Stores embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, ChromaDB) for efficient retrieval.
- Uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to fetch relevant context from the PDF based on user queries.
- Employs an LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Llama, or local models) to generate logical, context-aware answers.

#### d. Response Generator
- Formats and returns the answer to the user.
- Optionally provides references to the PDF sections used for the answer.

### 4. Data Flow
1. **User uploads PDF** via the interface.
2. **PDF Processor** extracts and preprocesses text.
3. **AI Reasoning Engine** embeds and stores the content, then retrieves relevant sections for each query.
4. **LLM** generates a logical answer based on the retrieved context.
5. **Response Generator** formats and returns the answer to the user.

### 5. Technology Stack
- **Python 3.9+**
- **PDF Extraction:** PyPDF2, pdfplumber, pytesseract (for OCR)
- **NLP/Embeddings:** Sentence Transformers, OpenAI API, HuggingFace Transformers
- **Vector DB:** FAISS, ChromaDB
- **LLM:** OpenAI GPT, Llama, or local LLMs
- **Interface:** Streamlit (web), CLI (argparse/click), or FastAPI (for API)

### 6. Extensibility
- Support for multiple file formats (DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- Multi-modal input (images, tables)
- Advanced agentic behaviors (tool use, multi-step reasoning)

### 7. Security & Privacy
- Local processing option for sensitive documents
- Secure file handling and deletion
